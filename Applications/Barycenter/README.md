# Barcyenter: The Two Body Problem

A barycenter is defined as the common centre of mass of two or more bodies orbiting one another.

For the two body problem, it's expressed as a distance from the center of the primary body (the one with the higher mass).

It's calculated as follows:

$$ r1 = {a \times m2 \over m1 + m2} $$

Where:

- r<sub>1</sub> = the distance from the primary body to the barycenter
- a = the distance between the two bodies (km)
- m<sub>1</sub> = mass of the primary body
- m<sub>2</sub> = mass of the secondary body
