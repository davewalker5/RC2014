This application uses the following method to calculate the phase of the moon using the following method:

1. Calculate the Julian date for the date entered
2. Subtract the Julian date for a known reference date when there was a New Moon
3. Calculate the number of lunar cycles represented by the remainder
4. The fractional part of the answer represents the fraction of the current lunar cycle
5. Use this to calculate the lunar age
6. Map the lunar age onto a description of the Moon's phase
